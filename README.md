- I like to understand the big picture and need to know all the rules before playing a game.

## How to best communicate with me
- I like direct questions, just ping me! I’m trying really hard to have a healthy work/life balance so if I’m not answering right away, please be mindful of my timezone and focus time.
- Don’t be a stranger! I’m always curious to know more about my team and in a pre-Covid environment, I would sometimes wander around the office to meet and chat with people from every department. I miss that about being remote.
- Written text is lacking tone and body language. If it’s for a harder conversation, video or in-person is probably best.
- Avoid acronyms, I find them not inclusive and also remember that I’m from a different culture.

## How you can help me
- I try really hard to acknowledge my biases so please let me know if you see me making wrong assumptions.
- I believe in radical candor for feedback and psychological safety. We should be able to help each other by communicating clearly and openly.

## What people misunderstand about me
- I’m a very confident introvert. I don’t mind speaking up and leading a conversation, but I need alone time to recharge, process and think.
- When I’m in a meeting, I like to have my hands occupied with something. It can look like I’m not paying attention – especially on a video chat – but I assure you that I’m listening.
- English is not my first language and I’m constantly frustrated by this limitation. I’m a totally different person in French and much more eloquent.

## Conditions I like to work in
- Ideally, I would want to work in an office with no more than 4 people. I like some company but open space offices freak me out.
- I think in-person meetings are very important, especially when kicking off a new project or when you never met someone.

## Times/hours I like to work
- Maker’s time in the morning, meetings in the afternoon.
- Interestingly, my most creative time is during my workout in the morning. I call it my Deep Workout®.

## Things I love
- Milk chocolate, Nutella, and ice cream. Yep, definitely a sweet tooth.
- Bouncing balls! I get instantly crazy in presence of a bouncing ball.
- Energetic music: mainly rock/metal/funk

## Other things to know about me
- Father of three wonderful daughters: Maya, June, and Zoé
- I’m a multi-instrumentalist but have mostly played electric guitar in bands since I was 16
- I’m from Paris, France originally but also half Greek – hence my last name – although I’m a third-generation immigrant and can barely talk.
